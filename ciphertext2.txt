Thanks for all your efforts to learn about scientific computing!

I know we have covered a lot of topics, but this was done just to give you a sense of what is possible with custom software.

The closer you get to cutting edge science, the less likely you will be able to just download an app that does exactly what you need.

If you can't write code you will at some point start to subconsciously limit the science you pursue to fit within the limitations of the software you can find.

So my question to you is just this:  will you let software dictate your science?

Or instead will you keep extending your scientific experiments and analysis by creating new software to help tackle the hardest problems?
